# Raw XML Data Storage Implementation - FIXED

## Problem SOLVED
The "i" button on user cards was making live API calls to Plex every time it was clicked, instead of using stored data that gets updated when the "Sync Users" button is pressed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- **Added `raw_plex_data` field** to the `User` model in `app/models.py`
- **Created migration** `migrations/versions/add_raw_plex_data_to_users.py`

### 2. Data Collection During Sync
- **Modified `app/services/plex_media_service.py`**:
  - Enhanced `get_users()` method to collect comprehensive raw data
  - Stores all Plex user object attributes, share details, and metadata
  - Data is stored as JSON string with timestamp

### 3. Data Storage During User Sync
- **Modified `app/routes/users.py`**:
  - Updated user sync process to store raw data for both new and existing users
  - Raw data gets updated every time "Sync Users" is clicked

### 4. Updated Debug Info Display - CRITICAL FIX
- **Modified `get_user_debug_info()` route**:
  - **ONLY uses stored data - NEVER makes API calls**
  - **No fallback API calls** - if no stored data, shows warning to sync users
  - Shows data source and last sync timestamp
  - Clear indication when no data is available with instructions to sync

## Key Benefits

1. **Zero API Calls**: "i" button NEVER makes API calls - instant response
2. **Reliability**: Works even if Plex server is temporarily unavailable  
3. **Data Consistency**: Shows exactly what was captured during last sync
4. **Performance**: Instant response when viewing debug info
5. **User Guidance**: Clear instructions when data needs to be synced
6. **Transparency**: Clear indication of data source and freshness

## Usage

1. **First time setup**: Run the migration to add the new database field
2. **Normal operation**: 
   - Click "Sync Users" to fetch and store fresh raw data
   - Click "i" button on any user card to view stored raw data instantly (NO API CALLS)
   - If no stored data exists, user gets clear message to sync first

## Files Modified

- `app/models.py` - Added raw_plex_data field
- `app/services/plex_media_service.py` - Enhanced data collection
- `app/routes/users.py` - Updated sync process and debug display (CRITICAL FIX)
- `migrations/versions/add_raw_plex_data_to_users.py` - Database migration

## Migration Command
```bash
flask db upgrade
```

## FIXED: No More API Calls
The "i" button now ONLY uses stored database data and will NEVER make API calls to Plex. Raw XML data is stored in the database and updated when the user sync button is pressed, exactly as requested.
