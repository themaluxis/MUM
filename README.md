MUM (Multimedia User Management) is a comprehensive, self-hosted web application that centralizes user management across multiple media servers and services. Built with a modern plugin architecture, MUM provides administrators with a unified dashboard to manage users, create sophisticated invite systems, monitor streaming activity, and maintain library access across diverse media platforms - all from one intuitive interface.

## Docker Deployment

The easiest way to deploy MUM is with Docker.

### Docker Compose

1.  **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:**
    ```yaml
    services:
      mum:
        image: ghcr.io/mrrobotjs/mum:latest
        container_name: mum
        restart: unless-stopped
        ports:
          - "5699:5000" # <host_port>:<container_port>
        volumes:
          - ./multimediausermanager:/app/instance
        environment:
          - TZ=America/New_York # REQUIRED: Set your local timezone
          - PUID=1000 # Optional: User ID for file permissions
          - PGID=1000 # Optional: Group ID for file permissions
    ```

2.  **Prepare Host Directory:**
    Create the directory on your host machine that you specified in the `volumes` section.
    ```bash
    mkdir ./multimediausermanager
    ```
    This directory will store the database and other persistent data.

3.  **Customize and Run:**
    *   Adjust the port mapping (`5699:5000`) if the host port is in use.
    *   Set the `TZ` environment variable to your local timezone (e.g., `Europe/London`).
    *   Run the application:
        ```bash
        docker-compose up -d
        ```

4.  **Initial Setup:**
    *   Access MUM in your browser at `http://<your_host_ip>:<host_port>` (e.g., `http://localhost:5699`).
    *   Follow the on-screen setup wizard to create an admin account, configure your media servers, and set the application's base URL.
